# Building and Exploring Controllers in NestJS

This was an assignment for my Mobile Applications Development course.

Objective: "To develop a foundational understanding of controllers in NestJS by creating a simple application with a focus on controllers, routing, and response handling."

How to run: Navigating to the project folder and running "npm run start" will start the application. I ran Postman to populate the dog array with data and was able to see the JSON data within the browser pointed at "localhost:3000/dogs". In the example below, I make a call to find dog with ID#5, which was deleted and therefore, nothing could be found!
